## ToDo (Homework):

Make a Makefile that compiles a LaTeX code 'code.tex' with pdflatex as follows:

1) Make a rule named `pdf` that compiles the code and removes all other outputs and keeps the .pdf
   
2) Make a rule named `display` that compiles the code and removes all other outputs and keeps the .pdf and displays the pdf
   
3) Make a rule that cleans everythig except the *.txt
